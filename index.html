										<p>Engagement, Collaboration and ultimately Synergy are part of this interactive session we call "Drumming. It is an interesting and decidedly different path to creating a breakthrough with teams in your organization. The end game is a leap in your abilities to create value together. That takes place in a process designed to unlock the power, wisdom and insight of any diverse team of people. Large group, small group - the process is the same to get in rhythm and know the difference between being in rhythm and know the difference between being in rhythm (creating value together) and being off beat.</p>

										<p>The Alchemy Workshop is an interactive songwriting and performance event that is memorable, fun and very engaging. What we are really working on is exercising your collective team’s creativity and creating the opportunity to push beyond each individual’s comfort zone. Participants who begin the session with the belief that they aren't very creative or know nothing about songwriting come away amazed at what they contributed and created. The tangible deliverable is <u>creating something of clear value</u> (the song) in a surprisingly short time frame. The lessons applied to your business are big, lasting and impactful.</p>
