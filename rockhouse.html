									<p>Group drumming is all about tapping into the energy of the collective.</p>
       
       								<p>You have to have teamwork to make music together. All barriers of age, gender, culture, language, specialized skills, and titles disappear.</p>
       
      								<p>Music has the power to transform, inspire and motivate us both as groups and as individuals. For centuries people have used drumming to develop a culture of co-operation, synchronization and confidence.</p>
       								
       								<p>We are going to have some fun and discover how different it is when we are experiencing the same physiological vibrations in the room because we are completely in rhythm. Being aligned, in sync, on the same page... has power on many levels.</p>
      
      								<p>Synchronization is a precursor to synergy. A lack of synergy could cost your organization in opportunity costs that you have not even quantified. It's very likely a lack of synergy has cost you many times on many occasions in situations - where problems could have been solved yet they weren't.</p>
       
       								<p>Immersing in this energy will cause people to act differently in their everyday life and has a residual effect on the participants.</p>
									
									<p>Companies are made up of different rhythms. Sales, marketing, administration etc.</p>
									
									<p>If those different rhythms can play the same beat, it increases our ability to speak the same language, focus and align on the same few priorities and achieve more and bigger wins.</p>
									
									<p>Participating in a “Rock The House” Interactive Drum Event provides an exercise in developing communication, effective listening skills and allows the group to develop the power of a non-verbal sense of mutual understanding and creativity.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Every engagement is designed for the unique priorities of the audience.</h3>
									<p>A conversation is a great place to start. Call us to explore the possibilities at 813.989.9900</p>
