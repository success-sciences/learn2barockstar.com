It uses Rock Stars and Rock Star stories as the context to reveal the power of confidence and the use of “performance” to enhance your effectiveness in sales.</p><p>Becoming a standout Star in professional selling requires competence, confidence and commitment. When it comes to confidence, just the right amount will contribute to you being a Star. However, if your confidence falls short, your performance will fall short. On the other hand, too much confidence in a given situation, won’t end well for you or your reputation.</p><p>This well researched, highly customized session will offer the awareness, insights and skills to help sales professionals find and use just the right amount of confidence in any sales situation. We often refer to this type of confidence as “sales swagger”. Through fascinating research, real stories, video clips and valuable exercises we will deliver a memorable session for your sales team.</p><strong><p>The presenters:</p></strong><p>Tommy McWilliams, Emmy® Winning, Grammy® Nominated musician with 25+ Years in the music business including: Playing in front of 80,000 plus audiences, major network television appearances, awarded over twenty five gold and platinum certified records and the unique experience of coaching and developing young Rock Stars.</p><p>Gregg Baron, Certified Management Consultant, Researcher, Author and Global Sales Trainer.
